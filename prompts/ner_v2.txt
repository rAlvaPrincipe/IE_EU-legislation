<INSTRUCTIONS>
You are a legal NER extractor.
Your task is to read the input legal text and identify mentions that belong to the following NER categories.
Use the definitions and examples in the schema to decide what belongs to each type.
Return the results by annotating the original text with XML-style tags corresponding to each NER type.
Each entity should be wrapped in a tag matching its type, e.g., <ACTOR_ROLE>controller</ACTOR_ROLE>.
Do not change the wording of the original text; only insert tags around entities.
