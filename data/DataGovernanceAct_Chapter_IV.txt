CHAPTER IV
Data altruism
Article 16
National arrangements for data altruism
Member States may have in place organisational or technical arrangements, or both, to facilitate data altruism.
To that end, Member States may establish national policies for data altruism.
Those national policies may, in particular, assist data subjects in making personal data related to them held by public sector bodies available voluntarily for data altruism, and set out the necessary information that is required to be provided to data subjects concerning the re-use of their data in the general interest.
3.6.2022
If a Member State develops such national policies, it shall notify the Commission thereof.
Article 17
Public registers of recognised data altruism organisations
1. Each competent authority for the registration of data altruism organisations shall keep and regularly update a public national register of recognised data altruism organisations.
2. The Commission shall maintain a public Union register of recognised data altruism organisations for information purposes.
Provided that an entity is registered in the public national register of recognised data altruism organisations in accordance with Article 18, it may use the label ‘data altruism organisation recognised in the Union’ in its written and spoken communication, as well as a common logo.
In order to ensure that recognised data altruism organisations are easily identifiable throughout the Union, the Commission shall, by means of implementing acts, establish a design for the common logo.
Recognised data altruism organisations shall display the common logo clearly on every online and offline publication that relates to their data altruism activities.
The common logo shall be accompanied by a QR code with a link to the public Union register of recognised data altruism organisations.
Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 33(2).
