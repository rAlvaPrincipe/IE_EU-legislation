Article 26
Requirements relating to competent authorities
1. The competent authorities for data intermediation services and the competent authorities for the registration of data altruism organisations shall be legally distinct from, and functionally independent of, any data intermediation services provider or recognised data altruism organisation.
The functions of the competent authorities for data intermediation services and the competent authorities for the registration of data altruism organisations may be carried out by the same authority.
Member States may either establish one or more new authorities for those purposes or rely on existing ones.
2. Competent authorities for data intermediation services and competent authorities for the registration of data altruism organisations shall exercise their tasks in an impartial, transparent, consistent, reliable and timely manner.
Where they exercise their tasks, they shall safeguard fair competition and non-discrimination.
3. The top-level management and personnel responsible for carrying out the relevant tasks of the competent authorities for data intermediation services and the competent authorities for the registration of data altruism organisations shall not be the designer, manufacturer, supplier, installer, purchaser, owner, user or maintainer of the services which they evaluate, nor the authorised representative of any of those parties.
This shall not preclude the use of evaluated services that are necessary for the operations of the competent authority for data intermediation services and the competent authority for the registration of data altruism organisations or the use of such services for personal purposes.
4. The top-level management and personnel of the competent authorities for data intermediation services and the competent authorities for the registration of data altruism organisations shall not engage in any activity that may conflict with their independence of judgment or integrity in relation to evaluation activities assigned to them.
5. The competent authorities for data intermediation services and the competent authorities for the registration of data altruism organisations shall have at their disposal the adequate financial and human resources to carry out the tasks assigned to them, including the necessary technical knowledge and resources.
6. The competent authorities for data intermediation services and the competent authorities for the registration of data altruism organisations of a Member State shall provide the Commission and competent authorities for data intermediation services and the competent authorities for the registration of data altruism organisations from other Member States, on reasoned request and without delay, with the information necessary to carry out their tasks under this Regulation.
Where a competent authority for data intermediation services or a competent authority for the registration of data altruism organisations considers the information requested to be confidential in accordance with Union and national law on commercial and professional confidentiality, the Commission and any other competent authorities for data intermediation services or competent authorities for the registration of data altruism organisations concerned shall ensure such confidentiality.

2. Proceedings pursuant to this Article shall be brought before the courts or tribunals of the Member State of the competent authority for data intermediation services or the competent authority for the registration of data altruism organisations against which the judicial remedy is sought individually or, where relevant, collectively by the representatives of one or more natural or legal persons.
