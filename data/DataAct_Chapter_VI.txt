CHAPTER VI
SWITCHING BETWEEN DATA PROCESSING SERVICES
Article 23
Removing obstacles to effective switching Providers of data processing services shall take the measures provided for in Articles 25, 26, 27, 29 and 30 to enable customers to switch to a data processing service, covering the same service type, which is provided by a different provider of data processing services, or to on-premises ICT infrastructure, or, where relevant, to use several providers of data processing services at the same time.
In particular, providers of data processing services shall not impose and shall remove pre-commercial, commercial, technical, contractual and organisational obstacles, which inhibit customers from:
(a) terminating, after the maximum notice period and the successful completion of the switching process, in accordance with Article 25, the contract of the data processing service;
(b) concluding new contracts with a different provider of data processing services covering the same service type;
(c) porting the customer’s exportable data and digital assets, to a different provider of data processing services or to an on-premises ICT infrastructure, including after having benefited from a free-tier offering;
(d) in accordance with Article 24, achieving functional equivalence in the use of the new data processing service in the ICT environment of a different provider of data processing services covering the same service type;
(e) unbundling, where technically feasible, data processing services referred to in Article 30(1) from other data processing services provided by the provider of data processing services.
Article 24
Scope of the technical obligations The responsibilities of providers of data processing services laid down in Articles 23, 25, 29, 30 and 34 shall apply only to the services, contracts or commercial practices provided by the source provider of data processing services.
Article 25
Contractual terms concerning switching
1. The rights of the customer and the obligations of the provider of data processing services in relation to switching between providers of such services or, where applicable, to an on-premises ICT infrastructure shall be clearly set out in a written contract.
The provider of data processing services shall make that contract available to the customer prior to signing the contract in a way that allows the customer to store and reproduce the contract.
2. Without prejudice to Directive (EU) 2019/770, the contract referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall include at least the following:
(a) clauses allowing the customer, upon request, to switch to a data processing service offered by a different provider of data processing services or to port all exportable data and digital assets to an on-premises ICT infrastructure, without undue delay and in any event not after the mandatory maximum transitional period of 30 calendar days, to be initiated after the maximum notice period referred to in point (d), during which the service contract remains applicable and during which the provider of data processing services shall:
