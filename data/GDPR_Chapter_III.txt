Article 12
Transparent information, communication and modalities for the
exercise of the rights of the data subject
1. The controller shall take appropriate measures to provide any
information referred to in Articles 13 and 14 and any communication
under Articles 15 to 22 and 34 relating to processing to the data subject
in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using
clear and plain language, in particular for any information addressed
specifically to a child. The information shall be provided in writing, or
by other means, including, where appropriate, by electronic means.
When requested by the data subject, the information may be provided
orally, provided that the identity of the data subject is proven by other
means.
2. The controller shall facilitate the exercise of data subject rights
under Articles 15 to 22. In the cases referred to in Article 11(2), the
controller shall not refuse to act on the request of the data subject for
exercising his or her rights under Articles 15 to 22, unless the controller
demonstrates that it is not in a position to identify the data subject.
3. The controller shall provide information on action taken on a
request under Articles 15 to 22 to the data subject without undue
delay and in any event within one month of receipt of the request.
That period may be extended by two further months where necessary,
taking into account the complexity and number of the requests. The
controller shall inform the data subject of any such extension within
one month of receipt of the request, together with the reasons for the
delay. Where the data subject makes the request by electronic form
means, the information shall be provided by electronic means where
possible, unless otherwise requested by the data subject.

4. If the controller does not take action on the request of the data
subject, the controller shall inform the data subject without delay and at
the latest within one month of receipt of the request of the reasons for
not taking action and on the possibility of lodging a complaint with a
supervisory authority and seeking a judicial remedy.
5. Information provided under Articles 13 and 14 and any communi­
cation and any actions taken under Articles 15 to 22 and 34 shall be
provided free of charge. Where requests from a data subject are mani­
festly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive
character, the controller may either:
(a) charge a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs
of providing the information or communication or taking the action
requested; or
(b) refuse to act on the request.
The controller shall bear the burden of demonstrating the manifestly
unfounded or excessive character of the request.
6. Without prejudice to Article 11, where the controller has
reasonable doubts concerning the identity of the natural person
making the request referred to in Articles 15 to 21, the controller
may request the provision of additional information necessary to
confirm the identity of the data subject.
7. The information to be provided to data subjects pursuant to
Articles 13 and 14 may be provided in combination with standardised
icons in order to give in an easily visible, intelligible and clearly legible
manner a meaningful overview of the intended processing. Where the
icons are presented electronically they shall be machine-readable.
8. The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in
accordance with Article 92 for the purpose of determining the
information to be presented by the icons and the procedures for
providing standardised icons.

(f) the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling,
referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) and, at least in those cases,
meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the
significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing
for the data subject.
3. Where the controller intends to further process the personal data
for a purpose other than that for which the personal data were collected,
the controller shall provide the data subject prior to that further
processing with information on that other purpose and with any
relevant further information as referred to in paragraph 2.

mentation, shall take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to

subject has requested the erasure by such controllers of any links to, or
copy or replication of, those personal data.
3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to the extent that processing is
necessary:
(a) for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information;

(e) for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
Article 18
Right to restriction of processing
1. The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller
restriction of processing where one of the following applies:

personal data;
02016R0679 — EN — 04.05.2016 — 000.002 — 19
▼B
(b) the processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure
of the personal data and requests the restriction of their use instead;
(c) the controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of
the processing, but they are required by the data subject for the
establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims;
(d) the data subject has objected to processing pursuant to Article 21(1)
pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the
controller override those of the data subject.
2. Where processing has been restricted under paragraph 1, such
personal data shall, with the exception of storage, only be processed
with the data subject's consent or for the establishment, exercise or
defence of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another
natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the
Union or of a Member State.
3. A data subject who has obtained restriction of processing pursuant
to paragraph 1 shall be informed by the controller before the restriction
of processing is lifted.

data or restriction of processing
The controller shall communicate any rectification or erasure of personal
data or restriction of processing carried out in accordance with

the data subject shall have the right to object at any time to processing
of personal data concerning him or her for such marketing, which

notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, the data subject may exercise
his or her right to object by automated means using technical
specifications.

research purposes or statistical purposes pursuant to Article 89(1), the

Article 22
Automated individual decision-making, including profiling
1. The data subject shall have the right not to be subject to a decision
based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which

(a) is necessary for entering into, or performance of, a contract between
the data subject and a data controller;
(b) is authorised by Union or Member State law to which the controller
is subject and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard
the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests; or
