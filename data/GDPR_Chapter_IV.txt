Article 24
Responsibility of the controller
1. Taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of
processing as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for the
rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall implement
appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure and to be
able to demonstrate that processing is performed in accordance with this
Regulation. Those measures shall be reviewed and updated where
necessary.

▼B
2. Where proportionate in relation to processing activities, the
measures referred to in paragraph 1 shall include the implementation
of appropriate data protection policies by the controller.
3. Adherence to approved codes of conduct as referred to in
Article 40 or approved certification mechanisms as referred to in
Article 42 may be used as an element by which to demonstrate
compliance with the obligations of the controller.
Article 25
Data protection by design and by default
1. Taking into account the state of the art, the cost of implementation
and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the
risks of varying likelihood and severity for rights and freedoms of
natural persons posed by the processing, the controller shall, both at
the time of the determination of the means for processing and at the
time of the processing itself, implement appropriate technical and
organisational measures, such as pseudonymisation, which are
designed to implement data-protection principles, such as data minimis­
ation, in an effective manner and to integrate the necessary safeguards
into the processing in order to meet the requirements of this Regulation
and protect the rights of data subjects.
2. The controller shall implement appropriate technical and organisa­
tional measures for ensuring that, by default, only personal data which
are necessary for each specific purpose of the processing are processed.
That obligation applies to the amount of personal data collected, the
extent of their processing, the period of their storage and their accessi­
bility. In particular, such measures shall ensure that by default personal
data are not made accessible without the individual's intervention to an
indefinite number of natural persons.
3. An approved certification mechanism pursuant to Article 42 may
be used as an element to demonstrate compliance with the requirements
set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article.
Article 26
Joint controllers
1. Where two or more controllers jointly determine the purposes and
means of processing, they shall be joint controllers. They shall in a
transparent manner determine their respective responsibilities for
compliance with the obligations under this Regulation, in particular as
regards the exercising of the rights of the data subject and their
respective duties to provide the information referred to in Articles 13
and 14, by means of an arrangement between them unless, and in so far
as, the respective responsibilities of the controllers are determined by
Union or Member State law to which the controllers are subject. The
arrangement may designate a contact point for data subjects.
02016R0679 — EN — 04.05.2016 — 000.002 — 24
▼B
2. The arrangement referred to in paragraph 1 shall duly reflect the
respective roles and relationships of the joint controllers vis-à-vis the
data subjects. The essence of the arrangement shall be made available to
the data subject.
3. Irrespective of the terms of the arrangement referred to in
paragraph 1, the data subject may exercise his or her rights under this
Regulation in respect of and against each of the controllers.
Article 27
Representatives of controllers or processors not established in the
Union
1. Where Article 3(2) applies, the controller or the processor shall
designate in writing a representative in the Union.
2. The obligation laid down in paragraph 1 of this Article shall not
apply to:
(a) processing which is occasional, does not include, on a large scale,
processing of special categories of data as referred to in Article 9(1)
or processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and
offences referred to in Article 10, and is unlikely to result in a risk
to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, taking into account
the nature, context, scope and purposes of the processing; or
(b) a public authority or body.
3. The representative shall be established in one of the Member
States where the data subjects, whose personal data are processed in
relation to the offering of goods or services to them, or whose behaviour
is monitored, are.
4. The representative shall be mandated by the controller or
processor to be addressed in addition to or instead of the controller or
the processor by, in particular, supervisory authorities and data subjects,
on all issues related to processing, for the purposes of ensuring
compliance with this Regulation.
5. The designation of a representative by the controller or processor
shall be without prejudice to legal actions which could be initiated
against the controller or the processor themselves.
Article 28
Processor
1. Where processing is to be carried out on behalf of a controller, the
controller shall use only processors providing sufficient guarantees to
implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a
manner that processing will meet the requirements of this Regulation
and ensure the protection of the rights of the data subject.
02016R0679 — EN — 04.05.2016 — 000.002 — 25
▼B
2. The processor shall not engage another processor without prior
specific or general written authorisation of the controller. In the case
of general written authorisation, the processor shall inform the controller
of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of other
processors, thereby giving the controller the opportunity to object to
such changes.
3. Processing by a processor shall be governed by a contract or other
legal act under Union or Member State law, that is binding on the
processor with regard to the controller and that sets out the
subject-matter and duration of the processing, the nature and purpose
of the processing, the type of personal data and categories of data
subjects and the obligations and rights of the controller. That contract
or other legal act shall stipulate, in particular, that the processor:
(a) processes the personal data only on documented instructions from
the controller, including with regard to transfers of personal data to
a third country or an international organisation, unless required to
do so by Union or Member State law to which the processor is
subject; in such a case, the processor shall inform the controller of
that legal requirement before processing, unless that law prohibits
such information on important grounds of public interest;
(b) ensures that persons authorised to process the personal data have
committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate
statutory obligation of confidentiality;
(c) takes all measures required pursuant to Article 32;
(d) respects the conditions referred to in paragraphs 2 and 4 for
engaging another processor;
(e) taking into account the nature of the processing, assists the
controller by appropriate technical and organisational measures,
insofar as this is possible, for the fulfilment of the controller's
obligation to respond to requests for exercising the data subject's
rights laid down in Chapter III;
(f) assists the controller in ensuring compliance with the obligations
pursuant to Articles 32 to 36 taking into account the nature of
processing and the information available to the processor;
(g) at the choice of the controller, deletes or returns all the personal
data to the controller after the end of the provision of services
relating to processing, and deletes existing copies unless Union or
Member State law requires storage of the personal data;
(h) makes available to the controller all information necessary to
demonstrate compliance with the obligations laid down in this
Article and allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections,
conducted by the controller or another auditor mandated by the
controller.
02016R0679 — EN — 04.05.2016 — 000.002 — 26
▼B
With regard to point (h) of the first subparagraph, the processor shall
immediately inform the controller if, in its opinion, an instruction
infringes this Regulation or other Union or Member State data
protection provisions.
4. Where a processor engages another processor for carrying out
specific processing activities on behalf of the controller, the same data
protection obligations as set out in the contract or other legal act
between the controller and the processor as referred to in paragraph 3
shall be imposed on that other processor by way of a contract or other
legal act under Union or Member State law, in particular providing
sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisa­
tional measures in such a manner that the processing will meet the
requirements of this Regulation. Where that other processor fails to
fulfil its data protection obligations, the initial processor shall remain
fully liable to the controller for the performance of that other processor's
obligations.
5. Adherence of a processor to an approved code of conduct as
referred to in Article 40 or an approved certification mechanism as
referred to in Article 42 may be used as an element by which to
demonstrate sufficient guarantees as referred to in paragraphs 1 and 4
of this Article.
6. Without prejudice to an individual contract between the controller
and the processor, the contract or the other legal act referred to in
paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article may be based, in whole or in part,
on standard contractual clauses referred to in paragraphs 7 and 8 of this
Article, including when they are part of a certification granted to the
controller or processor pursuant to Articles 42 and 43.
7. The Commission may lay down standard contractual clauses for
the matters referred to in paragraph 3 and 4 of this Article and in
accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 93(2).
8. A supervisory authority may adopt standard contractual clauses for
the matters referred to in paragraph 3 and 4 of this Article and in
accordance with the consistency mechanism referred to in Article 63.
9. The contract or the other legal act referred to in paragraphs 3 and
4 shall be in writing, including in electronic form.
10. Without prejudice to Articles 82, 83 and 84, if a processor
infringes this Regulation by determining the purposes and means of
processing, the processor shall be considered to be a controller in
respect of that processing.
02016R0679 — EN — 04.05.2016 — 000.002 — 27
▼B
Article 29
Processing under the authority of the controller or processor
The processor and any person acting under the authority of the
controller or of the processor, who has access to personal data, shall
not process those data except on instructions from the controller, unless
required to do so by Union or Member State law.
Article 30
Records of processing activities
1. Each controller and, where applicable, the controller's represen­
tative, shall maintain a record of processing activities under its respon­
sibility. That record shall contain all of the following information:
(a) the name and contact details of the controller and, where applicable,
the joint controller, the controller's representative and the data
protection officer;
(b) the purposes of the processing;

mentation of suitable safeguards;
(f) where possible, the envisaged time limits for erasure of the different
categories of data;
(g) where possible, a general description of the technical and organisa­
tional security measures referred to in Article 32(1).
2. Each processor and, where applicable, the processor's representa­
tive shall maintain a record of all categories of processing activities
carried out on behalf of a controller, containing:
(a) the name and contact details of the processor or processors and of
each controller on behalf of which the processor is acting, and,
where applicable, of the controller's or the processor's represen­
tative, and the data protection officer;
(b) the categories of processing carried out on behalf of each controller;
(c) where applicable, transfers of personal data to a third country or an

02016R0679 — EN — 04.05.2016 — 000.002 — 28
▼B
(d) where possible, a general description of the technical and organisa­
tional security measures referred to in Article 32(1).
3. The records referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be in writing,
including in electronic form.
4. The controller or the processor and, where applicable, the
controller's or the processor's representative, shall make the record
available to the supervisory authority on request.
5. The obligations referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply
to an enterprise or an organisation employing fewer than 250 persons
unless the processing it carries out is likely to result in a risk to the
rights and freedoms of data subjects, the processing is not occasional, or
the processing includes special categories of data as referred to in
Article 9(1) or personal data relating to criminal convictions and
offences referred to in Article 10.
Article 31
Cooperation with the supervisory authority
The controller and the processor and, where applicable, their represen­
tatives, shall cooperate, on request, with the supervisory authority in the
performance of its tasks.

Article 32
Security of processing
1. Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implemen­
tation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well
as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms
of natural persons, the controller and the processor shall implement
appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of
security appropriate to the risk, including inter alia as appropriate:
(a) the pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data;
(b) the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availabil­
ity and resilience of processing systems and services;
(c) the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a
timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident;
(d) a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effec­
tiveness of technical and organisational measures for ensuring the
security of the processing.
02016R0679 — EN — 04.05.2016 — 000.002 — 29
▼B
2. In assessing the appropriate level of security account shall be
taken in particular of the risks that are presented by processing, in
particular from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration,
unauthorised disclosure of, or access to personal data transmitted,
stored or otherwise processed.
3. Adherence to an approved code of conduct as referred to in
Article 40 or an approved certification mechanism as referred to in
Article 42 may be used as an element by which to demonstrate
compliance with the requirements set out in paragraph 1 of this Article.
4. The controller and processor shall take steps to ensure that any
natural person acting under the authority of the controller or the
processor who has access to personal data does not process them
except on instructions from the controller, unless he or she is required
to do so by Union or Member State law.
Article 33
Notification of a personal data breach to the supervisory authority
1. In the case of a personal data breach, the controller shall without
undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having
become aware of it, notify the personal data breach to the supervisory
authority competent in accordance with Article 55, unless the personal
data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of
natural persons. Where the notification to the supervisory authority is
not made within 72 hours, it shall be accompanied by reasons for the
delay.
2. The processor shall notify the controller without undue delay after
becoming aware of a personal data breach.
3. The notification referred to in paragraph 1 shall at least:
(a) describe the nature of the personal data breach including where
possible, the categories and approximate number of data subjects
concerned and the categories and approximate number of personal
data records concerned;
(b) communicate the name and contact details of the data protection
officer or other contact point where more information can be
obtained;
(c) describe the likely consequences of the personal data breach;
(d) describe the measures taken or proposed to be taken by the
controller to address the personal data breach, including, where
appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects.
4. Where, and in so far as, it is not possible to provide the
information at the same time, the information may be provided in
phases without undue further delay.
02016R0679 — EN — 04.05.2016 — 000.002 — 30
▼B
5. The controller shall document any personal data breaches,
comprising the facts relating to the personal data breach, its effects
and the remedial action taken. That documentation shall enable the
supervisory authority to verify compliance with this Article.
Article 34
Communication of a personal data breach to the data subject
1. When the personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to
the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall
communicate the personal data breach to the data subject without
undue delay.
2. The communication to the data subject referred to in paragraph 1
of this Article shall describe in clear and plain language the nature of
the personal data breach and contain at least the information and
measures referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 33(3).
3. The communication to the data subject referred to in paragraph 1
shall not be required if any of the following conditions are met:
(a) the controller has implemented appropriate technical and organisa­
tional protection measures, and those measures were applied to the
personal data affected by the personal data breach, in particular
those that render the personal data unintelligible to any person
who is not authorised to access it, such as encryption;
(b) the controller has taken subsequent measures which ensure that the
high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects referred to in
paragraph 1 is no longer likely to materialise;
(c) it would involve disproportionate effort. In such a case, there shall
instead be a public communication or similar measure whereby the
data subjects are informed in an equally effective manner.
4. If the controller has not already communicated the personal data
breach to the data subject, the supervisory authority, having considered
the likelihood of the personal data breach resulting in a high risk, may
require it to do so or may decide that any of the conditions referred to
in paragraph 3 are met.

Article 35
Data protection impact assessment
1. Where a type of processing in particular using new technologies,
and taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the
processing, is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of
02016R0679 — EN — 04.05.2016 — 000.002 — 31
▼B
natural persons, the controller shall, prior to the processing, carry out an
assessment of the impact of the envisaged processing operations on the
protection of personal data. A single assessment may address a set of
similar processing operations that present similar high risks.
2. The controller shall seek the advice of the data protection officer,
where designated, when carrying out a data protection impact
assessment.
3. A data protection impact assessment referred to in paragraph 1
shall in particular be required in the case of:
(a) a systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects relating to
natural persons which is based on automated processing, including
profiling, and on which decisions are based that produce legal
effects concerning the natural person or similarly significantly
affect the natural person;
(b) processing on a large scale of special categories of data referred to
in Article 9(1), or of personal data relating to criminal convictions
and offences referred to in Article 10; or
(c) a systematic monitoring of a publicly accessible area on a large
scale.
4. The supervisory authority shall establish and make public a list of
the kind of processing operations which are subject to the requirement
for a data protection impact assessment pursuant to paragraph 1. The
supervisory authority shall communicate those lists to the Board referred
to in Article 68.
5. The supervisory authority may also establish and make public a
list of the kind of processing operations for which no data protection
impact assessment is required. The supervisory authority shall
communicate those lists to the Board.
6. Prior to the adoption of the lists referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5,
the competent supervisory authority shall apply the consistency
mechanism referred to in Article 63 where such lists involve processing
activities which are related to the offering of goods or services to data
subjects or to the monitoring of their behaviour in several
Member States, or may substantially affect the free movement of
personal data within the Union.
7. The assessment shall contain at least:
(a) a systematic description of the envisaged processing operations and
the purposes of the processing, including, where applicable, the
legitimate interest pursued by the controller;
(b) an assessment of the necessity and proportionality of the processing
operations in relation to the purposes;
(c) an assessment of the risks to the rights and freedoms of data
subjects referred to in paragraph 1; and
(d) the measures envisaged to address the risks, including safeguards,
security measures and mechanisms to ensure the protection of
personal data and to demonstrate compliance with this Regulation
taking into account the rights and legitimate interests of data
subjects and other persons concerned.
02016R0679 — EN — 04.05.2016 — 000.002 — 32
▼B
8. Compliance with approved codes of conduct referred to in
Article 40 by the relevant controllers or processors shall be taken into
due account in assessing the impact of the processing operations
performed by such controllers or processors, in particular for the
purposes of a data protection impact assessment.
9. Where appropriate, the controller shall seek the views of data
subjects or their representatives on the intended processing, without
prejudice to the protection of commercial or public interests or the
security of processing operations.
10. Where processing pursuant to point (c) or (e) of Article 6(1) has
a legal basis in Union law or in the law of the Member State to which
the controller is subject, that law regulates the specific processing
operation or set of operations in question, and a data protection
impact assessment has already been carried out as part of a general
impact assessment in the context of the adoption of that legal basis,
paragraphs 1 to 7 shall not apply unless Member States deem it to be
necessary to carry out such an assessment prior to processing activities.
11. Where necessary, the controller shall carry out a review to assess
if processing is performed in accordance with the data protection impact
assessment at least when there is a change of the risk represented by
processing operations.
Article 36
Prior consultation
1. The controller shall consult the supervisory authority prior to
processing where a data protection impact assessment under Article 35
indicates that the processing would result in a high risk in the absence
of measures taken by the controller to mitigate the risk.
2. Where the supervisory authority is of the opinion that the intended
processing referred to in paragraph 1 would infringe this Regulation, in
particular where the controller has insufficiently identified or mitigated
the risk, the supervisory authority shall, within period of up to eight
weeks of receipt of the request for consultation, provide written advice
to the controller and, where applicable to the processor, and may use
any of its powers referred to in Article 58. That period may be extended
by six weeks, taking into account the complexity of the intended
processing. The supervisory authority shall inform the controller and,
where applicable, the processor, of any such extension within one
month of receipt of the request for consultation together with the
reasons for the delay. Those periods may be suspended until the super­
visory authority has obtained information it has requested for the
purposes of the consultation.
3. When consulting the supervisory authority pursuant to paragraph 1,
the controller shall provide the supervisory authority with:
(a) where applicable, the respective responsibilities of the controller,
joint controllers and processors involved in the processing, in
particular for processing within a group of undertakings;
02016R0679 — EN — 04.05.2016 — 000.002 — 33
▼B
(b) the purposes and means of the intended processing;
(c) the measures and safeguards provided to protect the rights and
freedoms of data subjects pursuant to this Regulation;
(d) where applicable, the contact details of the data protection officer;
(e) the data protection impact assessment provided for in Article 35;
and
(f) any other information requested by the supervisory authority.
4. Member States shall consult the supervisory authority during the
preparation of a proposal for a legislative measure to be adopted by a
national parliament, or of a regulatory measure based on such a legis­
lative measure, which relates to processing.
5. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, Member State law may require
controllers to consult with, and obtain prior authorisation from, the
supervisory authority in relation to processing by a controller for the
performance of a task carried out by the controller in the public interest,
including processing in relation to social protection and public health.

Article 37
Designation of the data protection officer
1. The controller and the processor shall designate a data protection
officer in any case where:
(a) the processing is carried out by a public authority or body, except
for courts acting in their judicial capacity;
(b) the core activities of the controller or the processor consist of
processing operations which, by virtue of their nature, their scope
and/or their purposes, require regular and systematic monitoring of
data subjects on a large scale; or
▼C1
(c) the core activities of the controller or the processor consist of
processing on a large scale of special categories of data pursuant
to Article 9 or personal data relating to criminal convictions and
offences referred to in Article 10.
▼B
2. A group of undertakings may appoint a single data protection
officer provided that a data protection officer is easily accessible from
each establishment.
3. Where the controller or the processor is a public authority or body,
a single data protection officer may be designated for several such
authorities or bodies, taking account of their organisational structure
and size.
02016R0679 — EN — 04.05.2016 — 000.002 — 34
▼B
4. In cases other than those referred to in paragraph 1, the controller
or processor or associations and other bodies representing categories of
controllers or processors may or, where required by Union or Member
State law shall, designate a data protection officer. The data protection
officer may act for such associations and other bodies representing
controllers or processors.
5. The data protection officer shall be designated on the basis of
professional qualities and, in particular, expert knowledge of data
protection law and practices and the ability to fulfil the tasks referred
to in Article 39.
6. The data protection officer may be a staff member of the controller
or processor, or fulfil the tasks on the basis of a service contract.
7. The controller or the processor shall publish the contact details of
the data protection officer and communicate them to the supervisory
authority.
Article 38

Article 42
Certification
1. The Member States, the supervisory authorities, the Board and the
Commission shall encourage, in particular at Union level, the estab­
lishment of data protection certification mechanisms and of data
protection seals and marks, for the purpose of demonstrating compliance
with this Regulation of processing operations by controllers and
processors. The specific needs of micro, small and medium-sized enter­
prises shall be taken into account.
2. In addition to adherence by controllers or processors subject to
this Regulation, data protection certification mechanisms, seals or marks
approved pursuant to paragraph 5 of this Article may be established for
the purpose of demonstrating the existence of appropriate safeguards
provided by controllers or processors that are not subject to this Regu­
lation pursuant to Article 3 within the framework of personal data
transfers to third countries or international organisations under the
terms referred to in point (f) of Article 46(2). Such controllers or
processors shall make binding and enforceable commitments, via
contractual or other legally binding instruments, to apply those appro­
priate safeguards, including with regard to the rights of data subjects.
3. The certification shall be voluntary and available via a process that
is transparent.

sibility of the controller or the processor for compliance with this Regu­
lation and is without prejudice to the tasks and powers of the super­
visory authorities which are competent pursuant to Article 55 or 56.

certification mechanism shall provide the certification body referred to
in Article 43, or where applicable, the competent supervisory authority,
with all information and access to its processing activities which are
