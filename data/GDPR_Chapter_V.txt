CHAPTER V
Transfers of personal data to third countries or international
organisations
Article 44
General principle for transfers
Any transfer of personal data which are undergoing processing or are
intended for processing after transfer to a third country or to an inter­
national organisation shall take place only if, subject to the other
provisions of this Regulation, the conditions laid down in this
Chapter are complied with by the controller and processor, including
for onward transfers of personal data from the third country or an
international organisation to another third country or to another inter­
national organisation. All provisions in this Chapter shall be applied in
order to ensure that the level of protection of natural persons guaranteed
by this Regulation is not undermined.
Article 45
Transfers on the basis of an adequacy decision
1. A transfer of personal data to a third country or an international
organisation may take place where the Commission has decided that the
third country, a territory or one or more specified sectors within that
third country, or the international organisation in question ensures an
adequate level of protection. Such a transfer shall not require any
specific authorisation.
2. When assessing the adequacy of the level of protection, the
Commission shall, in particular, take account of the following elements:
(a) the rule of law, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms,
relevant legislation, both general and sectoral, including concerning
public security, defence, national security and criminal law and the
access of public authorities to personal data, as well as the im­
plementation of such legislation, data protection rules, professional
rules and security measures, including rules for the onward transfer
of personal data to another third country or international organis­
ation which are complied with in that country or international
organisation, case-law, as well as effective and enforceable data
subject rights and effective administrative and judicial redress for
the data subjects whose personal data are being transferred;
(b) the existence and effective functioning of one or more independent
supervisory authorities in the third country or to which an inter­
national organisation is subject, with responsibility for ensuring and
enforcing compliance with the data protection rules, including
adequate enforcement powers, for assisting and advising the data
subjects in exercising their rights and for cooperation with the
supervisory authorities of the Member States; and

(c) the international commitments the third country or international
organisation concerned has entered into, or other obligations
arising from legally binding conventions or instruments as well as
from its participation in multilateral or regional systems, in
particular in relation to the protection of personal data.
3. The Commission, after assessing the adequacy of the level of
protection, may decide, by means of implementing act, that a third
country, a territory or one or more specified sectors within a third
country, or an international organisation ensures an adequate level of
protection within the meaning of paragraph 2 of this Article. The im­
plementing act shall provide for a mechanism for a periodic review, at
least every four years, which shall take into account all relevant deve­
lopments in the third country or international organisation. The imple­
menting act shall specify its territorial and sectoral application and,
where applicable, identify the supervisory authority or authorities
referred to in point (b) of paragraph 2 of this Article. The implementing
act shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure
referred to in Article 93(2).
4. The Commission shall, on an ongoing basis, monitor develop­
ments in third countries and international organisations that could
affect the functioning of decisions adopted pursuant to paragraph 3 of
this Article and decisions adopted on the basis of Article 25(6) of
Directive 95/46/EC.
5. The Commission shall, where available information reveals, in
particular following the review referred to in paragraph 3 of this
Article, that a third country, a territory or one or more specified
sectors within a third country, or an international organisation no
longer ensures an adequate level of protection within the meaning of
paragraph 2 of this Article, to the extent necessary, repeal, amend or
suspend the decision referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article by means
of implementing acts without retro-active effect. Those implementing
acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure
referred to in Article 93(2).
On duly justified imperative grounds of urgency, the Commission shall
adopt immediately applicable implementing acts in accordance with the
procedure referred to in Article 93(3).
6. The Commission shall enter into consultations with the third
country or international organisation with a view to remedying the
situation giving rise to the decision made pursuant to paragraph 5.
7. A decision pursuant to paragraph 5 of this Article is without
prejudice to transfers of personal data to the third country, a territory
or one or more specified sectors within that third country, or the inter­
national organisation in question pursuant to Articles 46 to 49.
8. The Commission shall publish in the Official Journal of the
European Union and on its website a list of the third countries, terri­
tories and specified sectors within a third country and international
organisations for which it has decided that an adequate level of
protection is or is no longer ensured.

9. Decisions adopted by the Commission on the basis of Article 25(6)
of Directive 95/46/EC shall remain in force until amended, replaced or
repealed by a Commission Decision adopted in accordance with
paragraph 3 or 5 of this Article.
Article 46
Transfers subject to appropriate safeguards
1. In the absence of a decision pursuant to Article 45(3), a controller
or processor may transfer personal data to a third country or an inter­
national organisation only if the controller or processor has provided
appropriate safeguards, and on condition that enforceable data subject
rights and effective legal remedies for data subjects are available.
2. The appropriate safeguards referred to in paragraph 1 may be

in the third country to apply the appropriate safeguards, including as
regards data subjects' rights; or
(f) an approved certification mechanism pursuant to Article 42 together
with binding and enforceable commitments of the controller or
processor in the third country to apply the appropriate safeguards,
including as regards data subjects' rights.
3. Subject to the authorisation from the competent supervisory auth­
ority, the appropriate safeguards referred to in paragraph 1 may also be
provided for, in particular, by:
(a) contractual clauses between the controller or processor and the
controller, processor or the recipient of the personal data in the
third country or international organisation; or
(b) provisions to be inserted into administrative arrangements between
public authorities or bodies which include enforceable and effective
data subject rights.

Article 48
Transfers or disclosures not authorised by Union law
Any judgment of a court or tribunal and any decision of an adminis­
trative authority of a third country requiring a controller or processor to
transfer or disclose personal data may only be recognised or enforceable
in any manner if based on an international agreement, such as a mutual
legal assistance treaty, in force between the requesting third country and
the Union or a Member State, without prejudice to other grounds for
transfer pursuant to this Chapter.
Article 49
Derogations for specific situations
1. In the absence of an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45(3),
or of appropriate safeguards pursuant to Article 46, including binding
corporate rules, a transfer or a set of transfers of personal data to a third
country or an international organisation shall take place only on one of
the following conditions:
(a) the data subject has explicitly consented to the proposed transfer,
after having been informed of the possible risks of such transfers for
the data subject due to the absence of an adequacy decision and
appropriate safeguards;
(b) the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between
the data subject and the controller or the implementation of
pre-contractual measures taken at the data subject's request;
(c) the transfer is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a
contract concluded in the interest of the data subject between the
controller and another natural or legal person;
(d) the transfer is necessary for important reasons of public interest;
(e) the transfer is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence
of legal claims;

data subject or of other persons, where the data subject is physically
or legally incapable of giving consent;

Member State law is intended to provide information to the public
and which is open to consultation either by the public in general or
by any person who can demonstrate a legitimate interest, but only to
the extent that the conditions laid down by Union or Member State
law for consultation are fulfilled in the particular case.

▼B
Where a transfer could not be based on a provision in Article 45 or 46,
including the provisions on binding corporate rules, and none of the
derogations for a specific situation referred to in the first subparagraph
of this paragraph is applicable, a transfer to a third country or an
international organisation may take place only if the transfer is not
repetitive, concerns only a limited number of data subjects, is
necessary for the purposes of compelling legitimate interests pursued
by the controller which are not overridden by the interests or rights and
freedoms of the data subject, and the controller has assessed all the
circumstances surrounding the data transfer and has on the basis of
that assessment provided suitable safeguards with regard to the
protection of personal data. The controller shall inform the supervisory
authority of the transfer. The controller shall, in addition to providing
the information referred to in Articles 13 and 14, inform the data subject
of the transfer and on the compelling legitimate interests pursued.
2. A transfer pursuant to point (g) of the first subparagraph of
paragraph 1 shall not involve the entirety of the personal data or
entire categories of the personal data contained in the register. Where
the register is intended for consultation by persons having a legitimate
interest, the transfer shall be made only at the request of those persons
or if they are to be the recipients.
3. Points (a), (b) and (c) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 and
the second subparagraph thereof shall not apply to activities carried out
by public authorities in the exercise of their public powers.
4. The public interest referred to in point (d) of the first subparagraph
of paragraph 1 shall be recognised in Union law or in the law of the
Member State to which the controller is subject.
5. In the absence of an adequacy decision, Union or Member State
law may, for important reasons of public interest, expressly set limits to
the transfer of specific categories of personal data to a third country or
an international organisation. Member States shall notify such
provisions to the Commission.
6. The controller or processor shall document the assessment as well
as the suitable safeguards referred to in the second subparagraph of
paragraph 1 of this Article in the records referred to in Article 30.
Article 50

effective enforcement of legislation for the protection of personal
data;
(b) provide international mutual assistance in the enforcement of legis­
lation for the protection of personal data, including through notifi­
cation, complaint referral, investigative assistance and information
exchange, subject to appropriate safeguards for the protection of
personal data and other fundamental rights and freedoms;
02016R0679 — EN — 04.05.2016 — 000.002 — 48
▼B
(c) engage relevant stakeholders in discussion and activities aimed at
furthering international cooperation in the enforcement of legislation
