Competence
1. Each supervisory authority shall be competent for the performance
of the tasks assigned to and the exercise of the powers conferred on it in
accordance with this Regulation on the territory of its own Member
State.
2. Where processing is carried out by public authorities or private
bodies acting on the basis of point (c) or (e) of Article 6(1), the super­
visory authority of the Member State concerned shall be competent. In
such cases Article 56 does not apply.

processing operations of courts acting in their judicial capacity.
Article 56
Competence of the lead supervisory authority
1. Without prejudice to Article 55, the supervisory authority of the
main establishment or of the single establishment of the controller or

cross-border processing carried out by that controller or processor in
accordance with the procedure provided in Article 60.
2. By derogation from paragraph 1, each supervisory authority shall
be competent to handle a complaint lodged with it or a possible

an establishment in its Member State or substantially affects data
subjects only in its Member State.

of the controller or processor in the Member State of which the super­
visory authority informed it.

the procedure provided in Article 60 shall apply. The supervisory

visory authority shall take utmost account of that draft when preparing
the draft decision referred to in Article 60(3).
