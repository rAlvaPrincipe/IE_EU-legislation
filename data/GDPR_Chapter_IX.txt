Article 87
Processing of the national identification number
Member States may further determine the specific conditions for the

of general application. In that case the national identification number or
any other identifier of general application shall be used only under
appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of the data subject
pursuant to this Regulation.
Article 88
Processing in the context of employment
1. Member States may, by law or by collective agreements, provide
for more specific rules to ensure the protection of the rights and
freedoms in respect of the processing of employees' personal data in
the employment context, in particular for the purposes of the
recruitment, the performance of the contract of employment, including
discharge of obligations laid down by law or by collective agreements,
management, planning and organisation of work, equality and diversity
in the workplace, health and safety at work, protection of employer's or
customer's property and for the purposes of the exercise and enjoyment,
on an individual or collective basis, of rights and benefits related to
employment, and for the purpose of the termination of the employment
relationship.
2. Those rules shall include suitable and specific measures to
safeguard the data subject's human dignity, legitimate interests and
fundamental rights, with particular regard to the transparency of
processing, the transfer of personal data within a group of undertakings,
or a group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity and
monitoring systems at the work place.
3. Each Member State shall notify to the Commission those
provisions of its law which it adopts pursuant to paragraph 1, by
25 May 2018 and, without delay, any subsequent amendment
affecting them.
Article 89
Safeguards and derogations relating to processing for archiving
purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research
purposes or statistical purposes
1. Processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific
or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, shall be subject to
appropriate safeguards, in accordance with this Regulation, for the rights
and freedoms of the data subject. Those safeguards shall ensure that
technical and organisational measures are in place in particular in order
to ensure respect for the principle of data minimisation. Those measures
may include pseudonymisation provided that those purposes can be
fulfilled in that manner. Where those purposes can be fulfilled by
further processing which does not permit or no longer permits the
identification of data subjects, those purposes shall be fulfilled in that
manner.

2. Where personal data are processed for scientific or historical
research purposes or statistical purposes, Union or Member State law
may provide for derogations from the rights referred to in Articles 15,
16, 18 and 21 subject to the conditions and safeguards referred to in
paragraph 1 of this Article in so far as such rights are likely to render
impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the specific purposes,
and such derogations are necessary for the fulfilment of those purposes.
3. Where personal data are processed for archiving purposes in the
public interest, Union or Member State law may provide for derogations
from the rights referred to in Articles 15, 16, 18, 19, 20 and 21 subject
to the conditions and safeguards referred to in paragraph 1 of this
Article in so far as such rights are likely to render impossible or
seriously impair the achievement of the specific purposes, and such
derogations are necessary for the fulfilment of those purposes.
4. Where processing referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 serves at the
same time another purpose, the derogations shall apply only to
processing for the purposes referred to in those paragraphs.
Article 90
Obligations of secrecy
1. Member States may adopt specific rules to set out the powers of
the supervisory authorities laid down in points (e) and (f) of
Article 58(1) in relation to controllers or processors that are subject,
under Union or Member State law or rules established by national
competent bodies, to an obligation of professional secrecy or other
equivalent obligations of secrecy where this is necessary and propor­
tionate to reconcile the right of the protection of personal data with the
obligation of secrecy. Those rules shall apply only with regard to
personal data which the controller or processor has received as a
result of or has obtained in an activity covered by that obligation of
secrecy.
2. Each Member State shall notify to the Commission the rules
adopted pursuant to paragraph 1, by 25 May 2018 and, without

Existing data protection rules of churches and religious associations

comprehensive rules relating to the protection of natural persons with
regard to processing, such rules may continue to apply, provided that
they are brought into line with this Regulation.
2. Churches and religious associations which apply comprehensive
rules in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article shall be subject
to the supervision of an independent supervisory authority, which may
be specific, provided that it fulfils the conditions laid down in
Chapter VI of this Regulation.
