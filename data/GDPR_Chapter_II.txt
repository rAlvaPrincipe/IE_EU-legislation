CHAPTER II
Principles
Article 5
Principles relating to processing of personal data
1. Personal data shall be:
(a) processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to
the data subject (‘lawfulness, fairness and transparency’);
(1 ) Directive (EU) 2015/1535 of the European Parliament and of the Council of
9 September 2015 laying down a procedure for the provision of information
in the field of technical regulations and of rules on Information Society
services (OJ L 241, 17.9.2015, p. 1).

(b) collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not
further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those
purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public
interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical
purposes shall, in accordance with Article 89(1), not be considered
to be incompatible with the initial purposes (‘purpose limitation’);
(c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the
purposes for which they are processed (‘data minimisation’);
(d) accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable
step must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate,
having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are
erased or rectified without delay (‘accuracy’);
(e) kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no
longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal
data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods
insofar as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving
purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research
purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1)
subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and organi­
sational measures required by this Regulation in order to safeguard
the rights and freedoms of the data subject (‘storage limitation’);
(f) processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the
personal data, including protection against unauthorised or
unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or
damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures
(‘integrity and confidentiality’).
2. The controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate
compliance with, paragraph 1 (‘accountability’).
Article 6
Lawfulness of processing
1. Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least
one of the following applies:
(a) the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her
personal data for one or more specific purposes;
(b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which
the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of
the data subject prior to entering into a contract;
(c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to
which the controller is subject;
(d) processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the
data subject or of another natura l person;
02016R0679 — EN — 04.05.2016 — 000.002 — 8
▼B
(e) processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in
the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in
the controller;
(f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests
pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such
interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and
freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal
data, in particular where the data subject is a child.
Point (f) of the first subparagraph shall not apply to processing carried
out by public authorities in the performance of their tasks.
2. Member States may maintain or introduce more specific provisions
to adapt the application of the rules of this Regulation with regard to
processing for compliance with points (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 by
determining more precisely specific requirements for the processing and
other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing including for other
specific processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX.
3. The basis for the processing referred to in point (c) and (e) of
paragraph 1 shall be laid down by:
(a) Union law; or
(b) Member State law to which the controller is subject.
The purpose of the processing shall be determined in that legal basis or,
as regards the processing referred to in point (e) of paragraph 1, shall be
necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest
or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller. That legal
basis may contain specific provisions to adapt the application of rules of
this Regulation, inter alia: the general conditions governing the
lawfulness of processing by the controller; the types of data which
are subject to the processing; the data subjects concerned; the entities
to, and the purposes for which, the personal data may be disclosed; the
purpose limitation; storage periods; and processing operations and
processing procedures, including measures to ensure lawful and fair
processing such as those for other specific processing situations as
provided for in Chapter IX. The Union or the Member State law
shall meet an objective of public interest and be proportionate to the
legitimate aim pursued.
4. Where the processing for a purpose other than that for which the
personal data have been collected is not based on the data subject's
consent or on a Union or Member State law which constitutes a
necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to
safeguard the objectives referred to in Article 23(1), the controller
shall, in order to ascertain whether processing for another purpose is
compatible with the purpose for which the personal data are initially
collected, take into account, inter alia:
(a) any link between the purposes for which the personal data have
been collected and the purposes of the intended further processing;
02016R0679 — EN — 04.05.2016 — 000.002 — 9
▼B
(b) the context in which the personal data have been collected, in
particular regarding the relationship between data subjects and the
controller;
(c) the nature of the personal data, in particular whether special
categories of personal data are processed, pursuant to Article 9, or
whether personal data related to criminal convictions and offences
are processed, pursuant to Article 10;
(d) the possible consequences of the intended further processing for
data subjects;
(e) the existence of appropriate safeguards, which may include
encryption or pseudonymisation.
Article 7
Conditions for consent
1. Where processing is based on consent, the controller shall be able
to demonstrate that the data subject has consented to processing of his
or her personal data.
2. If the data subject's consent is given in the context of a written
declaration which also concerns other matters, the request for consent
shall be presented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from the
other matters, in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear
and plain language. Any part of such a declaration which constitutes an
infringement of this Regulation shall not be binding.
3. The data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her
consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the
lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Prior
to giving consent, the data subject shall be informed thereof. It shall be
as easy to withdraw as to give consent.
4. When assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account
shall be taken of whether, inter alia, the performance of a contract,
including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the
processing of personal data that is not necessary for the performance of
that contract.
Article 8
Conditions applicable to child's consent in relation to information
society services
1. Where point (a) of Article 6(1) applies, in relation to the offer of
information society services directly to a child, the processing of the
personal data of a child shall be lawful where the child is at least 16
years old. Where the child is below the age of 16 years, such processing
shall be lawful only if and to the extent that consent is given or auth­
orised by the holder of parental responsibility over the child.
Member States may provide by law for a lower age for those purposes
provided that such lower age is not below 13 years.
02016R0679 — EN — 04.05.2016 — 000.002 — 10
▼B
2. The controller shall make reasonable efforts to verify in such cases
that consent is given or authorised by the holder of parental responsi­
bility over the child, taking into consideration available technology.
3. Paragraph 1 shall not affect the general contract law of Member
States such as the rules on the validity, formation or effect of a contract
in relation to a child.
Article 9
Processing of special categories of personal data
1. Processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin,
political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union
membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for
the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning
health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation
shall be prohibited.
2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply if one of the following applies:
(a) the data subject has given explicit consent to the processing of those
personal data for one or more specified purposes, except where
Union or Member State law provide that the prohibition referred
to in paragraph 1 may not be lifted by the data subject;
(b) processing is necessary for the purposes of carrying out the obli­
gations and exercising specific rights of the controller or of the data
subject in the field of employment and social security and social
protection law in so far as it is authorised by Union or Member
State law or a collective agreement pursuant to Member State law
providing for appropriate safeguards for the fundamental rights and
the interests of the data subject;
(c) processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data
subject or of another natural person where the data subject is
physically or legally incapable of giving consent;
(d) processing is carried out in the course of its legitimate activities
with appropriate safeguards by a foundation, association or any
other not-for-profit body with a political, philosophical, religious
or trade union aim and on condition that the processing relates
solely to the members or to former members of the body or to
persons who have regular contact with it in connection with its
purposes and that the personal data are not disclosed outside that
body without the consent of the data subjects;
(e) processing relates to personal data which are manifestly made
public by the data subject;
(f) processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of
legal claims or whenever courts are acting in their judicial capacity;
02016R0679 — EN — 04.05.2016 — 000.002 — 11
▼B
(g) processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest, on
the basis of Union or Member State law which shall be propor­
tionate to the aim pursued, respect the essence of the right to data
protection and provide for suitable and specific measures to
safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of the data
subject;
(h) processing is necessary for the purposes of preventive or occupa­
tional medicine, for the assessment of the working capacity of the
employee, medical diagnosis, the provision of health or social care
or treatment or the management of health or social care systems and
services on the basis of Union or Member State law or pursuant to
contract with a health professional and subject to the conditions and
safeguards referred to in paragraph 3;
(i) processing is necessary for reasons of public interest in the area of
public health, such as protecting against serious cross-border threats
to health or ensuring high standards of quality and safety of health
care and of medicinal products or medical devices, on the basis of
Union or Member State law which provides for suitable and specific
measures to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject, in
particular professional secrecy;
(j) processing is necessary for archiving purposes in the public interest,
scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in
accordance with Article 89(1) based on Union or Member State law
which shall be proportionate to the aim pursued, respect the essence
of the right to data protection and provide for suitable and specific
measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of the
data subject.
3. Personal data referred to in paragraph 1 may be processed for the
purposes referred to in point (h) of paragraph 2 when those data are
processed by or under the responsibility of a professional subject to the
obligation of professional secrecy under Union or Member State law or
rules established by national competent bodies or by another person also
subject to an obligation of secrecy under Union or Member State law or
rules established by national competent bodies.
4. Member States may maintain or introduce further conditions,
including limitations, with regard to the processing of genetic data,
biometric data or data concerning health.
Article 10
Processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and
offences
Processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences
or related security measures based on Article 6(1) shall be carried out
only under the control of official authority or when the processing is
authorised by Union or Member State law providing for appropriate
safeguards for the rights and freedoms of data subjects. Any compre­
hensive register of criminal convictions shall be kept only under the
control of official authority.

▼B
Article 11
Processing which does not require identification
1. If the purposes for which a controller processes personal data do
not or do no longer require the identification of a data subject by the
controller, the controller shall not be obliged to maintain, acquire or
process additional information in order to identify the data subject for
the sole purpose of complying with this Regulation.
2. Where, in cases referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, the
controller is able to demonstrate that it is not in a position to identify
the data subject, the controller shall inform the data subject accordingly,
if possible. In such cases, Articles 15 to 20 shall not apply except where
the data subject, for the purpose of exercising his or her rights under
those articles, provides additional information enabling his or her
identification.
