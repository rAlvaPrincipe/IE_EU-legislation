Article 60
Cooperation between the lead supervisory authority and the other
supervisory authorities concerned
1. The lead supervisory authority shall cooperate with the other
supervisory authorities concerned in accordance with this Article in an
endeavour to reach consensus. The lead supervisory authority and the
supervisory authorities concerned shall exchange all relevant
information with each other.
2. The lead supervisory authority may request at any time other
supervisory authorities concerned to provide mutual assistance
pursuant to Article 61 and may conduct joint operations pursuant to
Article 62, in particular for carrying out investigations or for monitoring
the implementation of a measure concerning a controller or processor
established in another Member State.
3. The lead supervisory authority shall, without delay, communicate
the relevant information on the matter to the other supervisory auth­
orities concerned. It shall without delay submit a draft decision to the
other supervisory authorities concerned for their opinion and take due
account of their views.

5. Where the lead supervisory authority intends to follow the relevant
and reasoned objection made, it shall submit to the other supervisory
authorities concerned a revised draft decision for their opinion. That

supervisory authority and the supervisory authorities concerned shall be
deemed to be in agreement with that draft decision and shall be bound
by it.
7. The lead supervisory authority shall adopt and notify the decision
to the main establishment or single establishment of the controller or
processor, as the case may be and inform the other supervisory auth­

summary of the relevant facts and grounds. The supervisory authority
with which a complaint has been lodged shall inform the complainant
on the decision.
8. By derogation from paragraph 7, where a complaint is dismissed
or rejected, the supervisory authority with which the complaint was

9. Where the lead supervisory authority and the supervisory auth­
orities concerned agree to dismiss or reject parts of a complaint and
to act on other parts of that complaint, a separate decision shall be
adopted for each of those parts of the matter. The lead supervisory
authority shall adopt the decision for the part concerning actions in
relation to the controller, shall notify it to the main establishment or
single establishment of the controller or processor on the territory of its
Member State and shall inform the complainant thereof, while the
supervisory authority of the complainant shall adopt the decision for

lishments in the Union. The controller or processor shall notify the
measures taken for complying with the decision to the lead supervisory
authority, which shall inform the other supervisory authorities
concerned.

orities concerned shall supply the information required under this

Mutual assistance
1. Supervisory authorities shall provide each other with relevant
information and mutual assistance in order to implement and apply
this Regulation in a consistent manner, and shall put in place
measures for effective cooperation with one another. Mutual assistance
shall cover, in particular, information requests and supervisory
measures, such as requests to carry out prior authorisations and consul­
tations, inspections and investigations.
2. Each supervisory authority shall take all appropriate measures
required to reply to a request of another supervisory authority without
undue delay and no later than one month after receiving the request.
Such measures may include, in particular, the transmission of relevant
information on the conduct of an investigation.
3. Requests for assistance shall contain all the necessary information,
including the purpose of and reasons for the request. Information
exchanged shall be used only for the purpose for which it was
requested.
4. The requested supervisory authority shall not refuse to comply
with the request unless:
(a) it is not competent for the subject-matter of the request or for the
measures it is requested to execute; or
(b) compliance with the request would infringe this Regulation or
Union or Member State law to which the supervisory authority
receiving the request is subject.
5. The requested supervisory authority shall inform the requesting
supervisory authority of the results or, as the case may be, of the

specific expenditure arising from the provision of mutual assistance in
exceptional circumstances.
8. Where a supervisory authority does not provide the information
referred to in paragraph 5 of this Article within one month of receiving
the request of another supervisory authority, the requesting supervisory
authority may adopt a provisional measure on the territory of its
Member State in accordance with Article 55(1). In that case, the
urgent need to act under Article 66(1) shall be presumed to be met
and require an urgent binding decision from the Board pursuant to
Article 66(2).

paragraph 6 of this Article. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in
accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 93(2).
Article 62
Joint operations of supervisory authorities
1. The supervisory authorities shall, where appropriate, conduct joint
operations including joint investigations and joint enforcement measures
in which members or staff of the supervisory authorities of other
Member States are involved.
2. Where the controller or processor has establishments in several
Member States or where a significant number of data subjects in
more than one Member State are likely to be substantially affected by
processing operations, a supervisory authority of each of those Member
States shall have the right to participate in joint operations. The super­
visory authority which is competent pursuant to Article 56(1) or (4)
shall invite the supervisory authority of each of those Member States
to take part in the joint operations and shall respond without delay to
the request of a supervisory authority to participate.
3. A supervisory authority may, in accordance with Member State
law, and with the seconding supervisory authority's authorisation, confer
powers, including investigative powers on the seconding supervisory
authority's members or staff involved in joint operations or, in so far
as the law of the Member State of the host supervisory authority
permits, allow the seconding supervisory authority's members or staff
to exercise their investigative powers in accordance with the law of the
Member State of the seconding supervisory authority. Such investigative
powers may be exercised only under the guidance and in the presence
of members or staff of the host supervisory authority. The seconding
supervisory authority's members or staff shall be subject to the
Member State law of the host supervisory authority.
4. Where, in accordance with paragraph 1, staff of a seconding
supervisory authority operate in another Member State, the
Member State of the host supervisory authority shall assume responsi­
bility for their actions, including liability, for any damage caused by
them during their operations, in accordance with the law of the
Member State in whose territory they are operating.
5. The Member State in whose territory the damage was caused shall
make good such damage under the conditions applicable to damage
caused by its own staff. The Member State of the seconding supervisory
authority whose staff has caused damage to any person in the territory
of another Member State shall reimburse that other Member State in full
any sums it has paid to the persons entitled on their behalf.
6. Without prejudice to the exercise of its rights vis-à-vis third parties
and with the exception of paragraph 5, each Member State shall refrain,
in the case provided for in paragraph 1, from requesting reimbursement
from another Member State in relation to damage referred to in
paragraph 4.

the second sentence of paragraph 2 of this Article, the other supervisory
authorities may adopt a provisional measure on the territory of its
Member State in accordance with Article 55. In that case, the urgent
need to act under Article 66(1) shall be presumed to be met and require
